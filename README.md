# Description
Quickly and safely build a lightweight Docker container for your dynamic Linux malware analysis.

When dynamically analyzing malware, it is important to properly isolate the analysis environment from the host machine. Docker containers offer a simple mechanism to run malware without affecting the underlying host. This container bundles common Linux Reverse Engineering tools to assist in analysis. For additional security, it is recommended to run the containers from within a host also created for malware analysis.

# Usage
![docker_linux](https://github.com/LaurieWired/linux_malware_analysis_container/assets/123765654/ac6e839a-c07a-4d4c-b567-b0edcca9a4f1)

## Running
Simply run the bash script passing the path to the file(s) you want to analyze as command line arguments:

```
linux_malware_analysis_container.sh MY_FILE_1 MY_FILE_2
```

This will build and start the Docker container and copy the target files into the container at ```/home/app```. Once built, it opens an interactive shell to the container where you can begin your analysis process. The container is based on Ubuntu meaning that standard Linux commands will work once connected. The following list contains additional suggestions of tools that may assist your reverse engineering:

- strace
- strings
- gdb
- objdump
- file

## Removing
Once you have completed your analysis, enter ```exit``` as the command. This will automatically kill and remove the container.
